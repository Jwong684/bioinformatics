# Bioinformatics

Compilation of code used for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) analyses.

Folders represent scripts for separate analyses:

1) [ampliconLib](https://github.com/Jwong684/bioinformatics/tree/master/ampliconLib): Scripts used to examine the proportion of a cell population that had a non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) event at the CRISPR-cas9-mediated cut-site after electroporation using a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex.

2) [libraryQC](https://github.com/Jwong684/bioinformatics/tree/master/libraryQC): Scripts used to quality check various metrics in NGS datasets.

3) [analyses](https://github.com/Jwong684/bioinformatics/tree/master/analyses): Scripts used for analyses of NGS libraries, including meDIP-seq, hmeDIP-seq, RNA-seq, WGBS, ChIP-seq.
