Coursework for STAT540 (https://stat540-ubc.github.io/) in 2017.

Use of R and bioinformatics tools (limma, edgeR) to examine microarray and RNA-seq datasets.

1) [Homework Q1-5](https://github.com/Jwong684/bioinformatics/tree/master/analyses/sampleCoursework/Homework-Q1-5.md)

2) [Homework Q6-10](https://github.com/Jwong684/bioinformatics/tree/master/analyses/sampleCoursework/Homework-Q6-10.md) 

3) [TCGA_project.md](https://github.com/Jwong684/bioinformatics/tree/master/analyses/sampleCoursework/TCGA_project.md) - This was the final project done for this course. It was a collaborative effort, but I will highlight my part in the RNA-seq analyses.
