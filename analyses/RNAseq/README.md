RNA-seq pipeline
================

Sequence reads were aligned to a transcriptome reference generated by JAGuar using mm10v38 reference genome annotated with read-length-specific exon-exon junction sequences. To quantify gene expression, reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM) were calculated. Both protein-coding and non-coding RNA were included within the analyses. Differentially expressed genes were called using a custom in-house matlab tool (DEFine, FDR cutoff = 0.05; RPKM > 0.01), which performs pair-wise comparisons by normalizing expression using GC content, followed by subsequent binning of similarly expressed genes together to determine the genes that varied the greatest within each bin.
