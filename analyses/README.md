NGS analyses
================

Subdirectories represent pipelines for examining:

1) [hmeDIP-seq](https://github.com/Jwong684/bioinformatics/tree/master/analyses/hmeDIP) (5hmC-immunoprecipitated DNA) - for calling differentially marked regions

2) [meDIP-seq](https://github.com/Jwong684/bioinformatics/tree/master/analyses/meDIP) (5mC-immunoprecipitated DNA) - for calling differentially marked regions

3) [RNA-seq](https://github.com/Jwong684/bioinformatics/tree/master/analyses/RNAseq) (for single replicates) - for calling differentially expressed genes
