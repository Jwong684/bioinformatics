NGS analyses
================

Subdirectories represent pipelines for examining:

1) [hmeDIP-seq](https://github.com/Jwong684/bioinformatics/tree/master/analyses/hmeDIP) (5hmC-immunoprecipitated DNA) - for calling differentially marked regions

2) [meDIP-seq](https://github.com/Jwong684/bioinformatics/tree/master/analyses/meDIP) (5mC-immunoprecipitated DNA) - for calling differentially marked regions

3) [RNA-seq](https://github.com/Jwong684/bioinformatics/tree/master/analyses/RNAseq) (for single replicates) - for calling differentially expressed genes

4) [GenerateFiles](https://github.com/Jwong684/bioinformatics/tree/master/analyses/GenerateFiles) - for generating downstream processed data-files from .bam (i.e. .wig, .bw); or for converting files to be used for uploading onto genomeBrowsers (i.e. UCSC)

5) [histoneChIP-seq](https://github.com/Jwong684/bioinformatics/tree/master/analyses/histoneChIP) - scripts used for analyses of histone ChIP-seq data.
